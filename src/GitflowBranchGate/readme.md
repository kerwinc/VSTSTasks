### Gitflow Branch Gate

This extension adds a build task to help control branch commits, enforce Gitflow conventions and branch limits. Essentially, set your builds on fire if your branching strategy, limits and rules are not followed.

[Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is a branching model for Git, created by Vincent Driessen. It's a standardised approach that allows teams to separate feature development, release and support for emergency fixes. Sounds amazing right? Well, there are a few gotchas especially when it comes to keeping all branches up to date and making sure conventions are followed.

### The Scenario

You're using the Gitflow branching model, or variation of it, Pull Requests with Team Foundation Server branch policies but need a way to prevent hotfixes\releases from being rolled back! Also, while you're at it, you want to prevent stale branches...

_Introducing the Gitflow Branch Gate build task..._

Keeping branches up to date becomes difficult as the number of developers, requirements or product delivery increases. Many teams try to adopt a trunk based branching strategy, and while this potentially solves many problems, it's not always possible. This build task aims to promote short-lived branches and assist in moving all branches forward.

### Features

- Configure branch naming standards and make sure they are followed
- Apply branch limits to hotfixes, release and feature branches
- Set builds on fire if branches become stale
- Make sure all branches are never behind the master branch
- Make sure all feature branches are never behind develop
- Prevent release & hotfix branches being created at the same time
- Track active Pull Requests from important branches to prevent deployed changes from being rolled back

### Reporting

The extension publishes a summary of the results to the build summary showing all issues:

A detailed log is provided with all rules configured for that build, branches and active Pull Requests at that point in time.

### Branch Limits

Apply branch limits for hotfixes, releases and feature branches:

### Branch Rules

Apply branch rules for all branches and active Pull Requests:

### Release Notes
#### 1.0.5

- Added check on PullRequest if feature is behind master or develop

#### 1.0.3

- Added the ability to bypass branches matching a wildcard pattern.

#### 0.4.3

- Updated rule description

#### 0.4.2

- Added a new setting to fail the current feature branch being built if its behind master ("Current feature must not be behind master").
- Reordered the rules in the build step settings to group similar rules together.

#### 0.3.22

- Fixed a bug where builds fail if queued from a Pull Request targeting master and "Master must not have any active Pull Requests" is turned on. Expected behaviour is that it should still fail if triggered another way.

#### 0.2.68

- Added exceptions to some rules to allow the build to pass if the current build was initiated from a Pull Request
- Added the branch name to the stale branch error message
- Improved the output summary in the build log

#### 0.2.64

- Added an exclusion to the _Active Pull Request_ rules if the current build's trigger was a Pull Request

#### 0.2.54

- Fixed a bug where multiple branch names were being printed for an issue

#### 0.2.42

- Initial Preview
